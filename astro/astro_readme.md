# Astro Readme

* This is a collection of very good intro-level notes/lectures/manuals that cover a broad range of topics. Although it is not possible to read all of them before you do research, but it is helpful to know they exist.

## Data Analysis

- [A Beginner's Guide to Working with Astronomical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13189)
	* Basics about astronomical data analysis using `Python`.

- [Astronomical Spectroscopy](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013pss2.book...35M)
	* by Philp Massey and Margaret Hanson. Very good introduction about the spectroscopic instrument and data reduction.

## Cosmology

	* This is a really useful note.  `little-h` can be really tricky!
