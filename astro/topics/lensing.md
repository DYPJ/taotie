## Strong Lensing

### Modeling

- [__PyAutoLens__ - Automated Strong Gravitational Lens Modeling](https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens)
    * From James Nightingale. Based on [Adaptive Semi-linear Inversion of Strong Gravitational Lens Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7436) and [AutoLens: Automated Modeling of a Strong Lens's Light, Mass and Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07377)

- [__lenstronomy__ - Software package for lens model reconstruction of imaging data](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy)
    * By Simon Birrer. __lenstronomy__ is a multi-purpose package to model strong gravitational lenses.
    * Based on [Lenstronomy: multi-purpose gravitational lens modelling software package](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09746v1)

- [__vislens__ - Module for modeling gravitational lensing systems in which the data are not images but interferometric visibilities](https://github.com/jspilker/visilens)
    * __Visilens__ is a python module for modeling gravitational lensing systems observed by a radio/mm interferometer like ALMA or ATCA.
