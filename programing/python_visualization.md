# Visualization using Python

## Basics
* [Ten simple rules for better figures](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833&type=printable)
  - [1]: Know Your Audience; [2]: Identify Your Message; [3]: Adapt the Figure to the Support Medium; [4]: Captions are not Optional; [5]: Do Not trust the Defaults; [6]: Use Color Effectively; [7]: Do Not Mislead the Reader; [8]: Avoid ‘‘Chartjunk’’; [9]: Message Trumps Beauty; [10]: Get the Right Tool

* [Basic guide for plotting with Matplotlib](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/)
	- This is a very good introduction for Matplotlib

## Great Examples

* [Textbook Figures for Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy](http://www.astroml.org/book_figures/index.html)


### SciPy John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Contest

* [The 2013 gallery](http://conference.scipy.org/jhepc2013/index.html) - Many are astronomy related and excellent examples
* [The 2014 gallery](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~nvaroquaux/jhepc/index.html)
* [The 2015 gallery](https://scipy2016.scipy.org/ehome/115969/276538/) Link not working...

## Color and Colour

* [Your Friendly Guide to Colors in Data Visualisation](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorguide/)
	- Pretty much the only thing you need to read about color.
* [Why rainbow colormap is harmful](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/2017/08/23/the-rainbow-colour-map/)

### Matplotlib

* [Gallery of named colors in Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/named_colors.html)
* [Gallery of colormaps in Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html)

### Fancier and Better

* [ColorBrewer2 - Interactive colormap builder](http://colorbrewer2.org)
* [Nippon Colors - Fancy traditional Japanese colors](http://nipponcolors.com)

### Better Colormaps

* [Palettable - Color palettes for Python](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/)
	- Really useful, with a lot of nice selections. Including color palettable from Wes Anderson movies.

* [CMasher: Scientific colormaps for making accessible, informative and cmashing plots](https://cmasher.readthedocs.io/index.html)
	- "The colormaps in CMasher are all designed to be perceptually uniform sequential using the viscm package; most of them are color-vision deficiency (CVD; color blindness) friendly"

* [Scientific Colour-Maps by Fabio Crameri](http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/visualisation.php)
	- "Scientific colour-maps, like the colour maps devon, davos, oslo, and broc, are perceptually uniform, perceptually ordered, readable as B&W print and colour-vision-deficiency (CVD) friendly."
