# Extragalactic Data and Projects 

## HST Surveys and Large Projects

* [3D-HST - A Spectroscopic Galaxy Evolution Survey with the Hubble Space Telescope](https://3dhst.research.yale.edu/Home.html)
  - 3D-HST surveyed ~600 square arcminutes of well-studied extragalactic survey fields (AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, UKIDSS-UDS) with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with ACS/G800L coverage. The short acquisition images, taken in the WFC3/F140W and ACS/F814W filters used for wavelength reference for the spectra, are also deeper than most ground-based observations.

## Ground-base IFU surveys

* [MUSE-Wide project](https://musewide.aip.de/project/)
	- MUSE Survey of GOODS-S/CDFS and CANDELS-COSMOS areas.

## Groud-base Imaging surveys

* [Deep Hyper Suprime-Cam Images and a Forced Photometry Catalog in W-CDF-S](https://zenodo.org/record/2225161#.XBnQji2ZOV5)
	- Both catalogs and reduced HSC data are available here
	- Associated RNASS note can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07565)


## Useful dataset and tools

* [LASD - Lyman Alpha Spectral Database](http://lasd.lyman-alpha.com)
	- Lyman Alpha Spectral Database will facilitate comparison of Lya spectral modelling and observations.
