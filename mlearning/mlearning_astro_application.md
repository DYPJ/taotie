# Astrophysical and Cosmological Applications of Machine Learnings

* This is Jun, 2019, and an ADS search of "machine learning" in the abstract of referred astronomy journals result in **711** papers, so it is almost too late to try to "read everything"...but at least we can try:

* And, again, this list only reflects one person's taste.
