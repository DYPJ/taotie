# Resource about C and C++ Programming Language

## Learning C

* [learn-c.org free interactive C tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org/)

## Useful Libraries

### Numerical

* [`GSL` - GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
    - The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.
    - The [online reference manual can be found here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html).

* [`FFTW`]()
    - `FFTW` is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).
    - The [online manual can be found here](http://fftw.org/fftw3_doc/)
