# Python Implementations of Statistical Methods


#### Survival Analysis

* Traditionally, [survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) was developed to measure lifespans of individuals. The analysis can be further applied to not just traditional births and deaths, but any duration.
* **Survival function**: the survival function defines the probability the death event has not occured yet at time t, or equivalently, the probability of surviving past time t
* **Hazard curve**: the probability of the death event occurring at time t, given that the death event has not occurred until time t. Hazard function is non-parametric.
* **Kaplan-Meier estimator for survival function**: Survival analysis assumes that upper limits have the same underlying distribution as the data, and the Kaplan-Meier esti- mator further assumes that detections and upper limits are mutually independent
