# Resource about C++ Programming Language

## Learning C++

* **The best way to learn programming is, always, writing your own code!**

* [`CppCoreGuidelines` - The C++ Core Guidelines are a set of tried-and-true guidelines, rules, and best practices about coding in C++](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines)
    - The [website version is here](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#main)
    - The C++ Core Guidelines are a collaborative effort led by Bjarne Stroustrup, much like the C++ language itself. They are the result of many person-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations.
    - [A Chinese translation can be found here](https://github.com/lynnboy/CppCoreGuidelines-zh-CN)

* [LearnCpp.com - Tutorials to help you master C++ and object-oriented programming](https://www.learncpp.com/)
    - LearnCpp.com is a free website devoted to teaching you how to program in C++. Whether you’ve had any prior programming experience or not, the tutorials on this site will walk you through all the steps to write, compile, and debug your C++ programs, all with plenty of examples.

* [Awesome Modern C++ - A collection of resources on modern C++](https://github.com/rigtorp/awesome-modern-cpp)
    - The goal is to collect a list of resources to help people learn about and leverage modern C++11 and beyond. The [website is here](https://awesomecpp.com/)

* [Modern CPP Tutorial - C++11/14/17](https://github.com/changkun/modern-cpp-tutorial)
    - This is a **Chinese** on-line book: <高速上手 C++11/14/17>

* [`modern-cpp-features` - A cheatsheet of modern C++ language and library features](https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features)
    - Descriptions and examples of new features in C++

### For Python Coders

* [A Transition Guide from Python 2.x to C++](https://cs.slu.edu/~goldwasser/publications/python2cpp.pdf)

## Useful Libraries

### Performance

* [`cpp-taskflow` - Modern C++ Parallel Task Programming Library](https://github.com/cpp-taskflow/cpp-taskflow)
    - A fast C++ header-only library to help you quickly write parallel programs with complex task dependencies

* [`mimalloc` - mimalloc is a compact general purpose allocator with excellent performance](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc)
    - By Microsoft. mimalloc (pronounced "me-malloc") is a general purpose allocator with excellent performance characteristics. It is a drop-in replacement for malloc and can be used in other programs without code changes.

### Numerical

* [`GSL` - GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
    - The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.
    - The [online reference manual can be found here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html).

* [`Eigen` - a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

* [`Armadillo` - C++ library for linear algebra & scientific computing](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
    - `Armadillo` is a high quality linear algebra library (matrix maths) for the C++ language, aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use

### Astronomy Related

* [`CCfits` - object oriented interface to the cfitsio library](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/)
    - It is designed to make the capabilities of cfitsio available to programmers working in C++. It is written in ANSI C++ and implemented using the C++ Standard Library with namespaces, exception handling, and member template functions.

## Code to Study

* [`GalSim` - The modular galaxy image simulation toolkit](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim)
    - `GalSim` is a very sophisticated system that pretty much includes everything you need to know about optics, observational astronomy, photometry, models of galaxies, and weak lensing.
    - It also teachs you how to communicate between C++ and Python.

* [`imfit` - an open-source astronomical image-fitting program](https://github.com/perwin/imfit)
    - Everything on modeling galaxies using least-chi-square or MCMC methods.

* [`libprofit` - low-level C++ library that produces images based on different luminosity profiles](https://github.com/ICRAR/libprofit)
    - Light-weight library to learn about modeling galaxies and image convolution.

* [`TreeCorr` - Code for efficiently computing 2-point and 3-point correlation functions](https://github.com/rmjarvis/TreeCorr)
