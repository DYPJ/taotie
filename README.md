* “The taotie is a motif commonly found on Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasty” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taotie)

## Motivation and Goal

* Over the past ~10 years, I have gradually accumulated some useful resources for astrophysical research and I believe the best way to make use of these information is to share them.
* **The goal of `taotie`** is to become a curated list of resources for astronomy and astrophysics maintained by the community. Just like many other `awesome` lists available on `GitHub`. We hope `taotie` can become the first stop for new student or researcher in astronomy to seek for practical guidance and experience.  And `taotie` can also be a handy and organized "bookmark" for researchers in different fields.

## Progress and Plans

* The main language for `taotie` is English. Some of the important documents will be slowly translated into Chinese.
* Now `taotie` is available on both `GitHub` and `GitLab`.  And you can also find `taotie` using [this address](https://dr-guangtou.github.io/taotie/)
* **Under Construction**: This repo is still under heavy and frequent development. I am currently working on this as a weekend project.

* Please let me know if you have any suggestion or recommendation.
