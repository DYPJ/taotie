# Tao Tie (饕餮) - A curated collection of resources for astrophysical research

<img src="doc/taotie_logo.png" width="60%">

----

* “The taotie is a motif commonly found on Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasty” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taotie)

* Over the last few years, I have tried to collect useful resources for astrophysical research in several different ways.  Now, it seems a GitHub repo is the best solution. I will gradually transfer my notes and bookmarks here. This place is still heavily under construction. I will create a series of notes first, and I am thinking about what is the best way to organize them later. 

* Please let me know if you have any suggestion or recommendation.


## Contents
-----------

## Prepare yourself for scientific research

- [Setup your computer for research](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/computer_basics.md)
    * Shell, command line tool, and system related stuff.

- [On writing scientific papers](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/writing_paper.md) 
    * General advices, examples, and `LaTeX` related topics.

- [A little bit background in statistics](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/stats_basic.md)
    * Courses and tutorials in statistics. Nowadays, you cannot get anywhere in astrophysics and cosmology without having enough knowledge of statistics.

- [A little bit background in data science](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/data_science.md)
    * Data science related tutorial and cheatsheets.

## Starting your journey as astronomer

- [Good reference for all astronomers](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/astro/astro_readme.md)
    * Reference and handbooks that will be handy in research.

- [Basic tools for astrophysical research](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/astro/astro_research_basic.md)
    * Flux, extinction, coordinates, and planning your observations.  Whatever you need.

## `Python` - the official language for astronomers...for now

- [Basic Python knowledges](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_basic.md)
    
- [On writing your own Python package](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_write_yourown_project.md)

- [On improving the performance of your Python code](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_performance.md)

- [Data fitting, parameter optimization, model constraints...you know, astrophysics](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_optimazaton.md)

- [Doing statistical analysis right in Python](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_statistics.md)

- [Making pretty pictures and other visualizations in Python](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_visualization.md)

## Machine Learning 

* Since machine learning is becoming more and more important in astrophysics and cosmology, I am giving it an independent directory now.

- [Basics of machine learning](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/mlearning/machine_learning_basic.md)
    * Online books, courses, handbooks...right now there are too many of them, so this might not be your best choice. 

## Resources for a Specific Topic in Astrophysics or Cosmology

* There is no way this is even close to a complete list.  It only reflects the interests of the author.  Contributions are welcomed, and will try to organize it better.

- [Basic tools for cosmology research](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/cosmology_tools.md)
    * CMB, 2PCF, and dark matter halos. All the fancy words you need in cosmology.

- [List of important extragalactic surveys and data](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/extragalactic_projects_and_data.md)
    * This could be a really...really long list, and should be organized better. 

- [What about dust?](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/ism_and_dust.md)
    * And all the other inappropriate questions in astrophysics.
