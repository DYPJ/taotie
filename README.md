* “The taotie is a motif commonly found on Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasty” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taotie)

## Motivation and Goal

* Over the past ~10 years, I have gradually accumulated some useful resources for astrophysical research and I believe the best way to make use of these information is to share them.
* **The goal of `taotie`** is to become a curated list of resources for astronomy and astrophysics maintained by the community. Just like many other `awesome` lists available on `GitHub`. We hope `taotie` can become the first stop for new student or researcher in astronomy to seek for practical guidance and experience.  And `taotie` can also be a handy and organized "bookmark" for researchers in different fields.

## Progress and Plans

* The main language for `taotie` is English. Some of the important documents will be slowly translated into Chinese.
* Now `taotie` is available on both `GitHub` and `GitLab`.  And you can also find `taotie` using [this address](https://dr-guangtou.github.io/taotie/)
* **Under Construction**: This repo is still under heavy and frequent development. I am currently working on this as a weekend project.

* Please let me know if you have any suggestion or recommendation.

    - [A little bit background in data science](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/data_science.md)
    - [Also some information about machine learning](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/research/machine_learning.md)
        * Including the [basic learning materials](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/machine_learning.md/machine_learning_basic.md), [some useful tools](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/machine_learning.md/machine_learning_tools.md), and [examples of applications in astronomy](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/research/machine_learning.md/mlearning_astro_application.md)

## [Astronomy or Astrophysics Related Topics](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/astro)
    - [Basic tools for astrophysical research](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/astro/astro_research_basic.md) e.g. Flux, extinction, coordinates, and planning your observations.  Whatever you need.
    - [Good reference for all astronomers](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/astro/astro_readme.md): Reference and handbooks that will be handy in research.


## [`Python` - the official language for astronomers...for now](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/python)

- [Basic Python knowledges](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_basic.md)

- [On writing your own Python package](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/python/python_write_yourown_project.md)

## [Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI related](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/mlearning)

* Since machine learning is becoming more and more important in astrophysics and cosmology, I am giving it an independent directory now.

- [Basics of machine learning](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/mlearning/machine_learning_basic.md)
    * Online books, courses, handbooks...right now there are too many of them, so this might not be your best choice.

## [Resources for a Specific Topic in Astrophysics or Cosmology](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/topics)

* There is no way this is even close to a complete list.  It only reflects the interests of the author.  Contributions are welcomed, and will try to organize it better.

- [Basic tools for cosmology research](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/cosmology_tools.md)
    * CMB, 2PCF, and dark matter halos. All the fancy words you need in cosmology.

- [List of important extragalactic surveys and data](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/extragalactic_projects_and_data.md)
    * This could be a really...really long list, and should be organized better.

- [Photometry of galaxies and stars](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/photometry.md)
    * The most fundamental and the most difficult task of astrophysical observations.

    * And all the other inappropriate questions in astrophysics.

## [Readling List of Interesting Astrophysical Topics](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/reference)

* Again, right now this is just a personal list of interesting topics.
* Now, it includes reading list on [galaxy cluster cosmology](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/reference/cluster_cosmology.md), [halo splashback radius](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/reference/halo_splashback_radius.md), [intrinsic alignment of galaxies](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/reference/wl_intrinsic_alignment.md)
