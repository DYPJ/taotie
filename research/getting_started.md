# Getting Started as Researcher

## Organize Project

* [`GitHub`](https://github.com/) or any other on line code repositories (e.g. [`GitLab`](https://about.gitlab.com/), [`bitbucket`](https://bitbucket.org/), [`coding`](https://coding.net/git)) can help organize your scientific project. It can help you do version control, back up research results, and also share results and code with the community.  
* There are template available that can help you get started:
    - [shablona - A template for small scientific python projects](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona)
* And `GitHub` allows you to [create new repository based on a template](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates)

## Backup Research Project

* This is as important as you can possibly imagine.
    - You should constantly back-up your harddrive using external harddrive. Both MacOSX and Linux have systems that help you backup data.
    - It is encouraged to use service like the [`Dropbox`](https://www.dropbox.com) to constantly backup important research-related files (e.g. draft, code, and figures). In mainland China, [`jianguoyun` (坚果云)](https://www.jianguoyun.com/) is an alternative.

## Reading Paper 

* It is important to read as much as you can. It is important to follow `arXiv` regularly.
    - You can check if your institute is using [voxCharta](https://www.voxcharta.org), a on-line platform to vote on papers and organize `arXiv` discussion.
    - It is good idea to have a routine that keeps record of interesting papers.  Here is an examply by [me](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/daily_astroph)

* [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) is a very good website to follow recent interesting papers from the perspective of a graduate student. 
    - They also provide some good advices on reading papers: [Part I](https://astrobites.org/2017/12/19/tools-for-reading-papers-part-1/), [Part II](https://astrobites.org/2018/03/09/tools-for-reading-papers-part-2/), [Part III](https://astrobites.org/2018/09/06/tools-for-reading-papers-part-3/)

## Communication 

* [`Slack`](https://slack.com/) has become the most common way to organize a small collaboration.  Even the free version can be very useful.
* Telecon becomes more and more frequently used to communicate among collaborators in different institutes and timezones.  Commonly used telecon tools including [`Skype`](https://www.skype.com/en/), [`zoom`](https://zoom.us/), [`GoToMeetings`](https://www.gotomeeting.com/)
    - All of these tools are free and cross-platform, and easy to use. You can share screen using them for remote presentation too.
* [Doodle](https://doodle.com/make-a-poll) is the most commonly used tool to create a poll to decide the time slot for a meeting or telecon. 

### Personal Website

* It is actually pretty important to have a visible personal website that links your CV and contact information.  Make sure that it can be found by search engine.
* This is especially important if you try to find job in another country (e.g. get a PhD in China, want a post-doc job in Europe) or when you know the hiring committee is not familiar with you.

* [`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com/) is pretty good choice to make a nice-looking personal website.  And there are some [easy-to-use templates available](https://pages.github.com/themes/), and there are [more fancy ones available](https://jekyllthemes.io/github-pages-templates)
    - [How to Create a Simple Academic Website](https://marisacarlos.com/pages/create-simple-academic-website)

* [al-folio - A beautiful Jekyll theme for academics](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)
    * This is a pretty good template for academic personal wesbsite

* Good examples (personal choice: clean and informative)
