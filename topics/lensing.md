## Strong Lensing

### Modeling

- [`PyAutoLens` - Automated Strong Gravitational Lens Modeling](https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens)
    * From James Nightingale. Based on [Adaptive Semi-linear Inversion of Strong Gravitational Lens Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7436) and [AutoLens: Automated Modeling of a Strong Lens's Light, Mass and Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07377)

- [`lenstronomy` - Software package for lens model reconstruction of imaging data](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy)
    * By Simon Birrer. `lenstronomy` is a multi-purpose package to model strong gravitational lenses.
    * Based on [Lenstronomy: multi-purpose gravitational lens modelling software package](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09746v1)
