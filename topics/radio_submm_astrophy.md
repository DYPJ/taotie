# Resources and Tools for Radio and Submm Astronomy

**Just started**

-----

* [`wise` - Wavelet Image Segmentation and Evaluation tool](https://github.com/flomertens/wise)
    - `wise` is developed to address the issue of detecting significant features in radio interferometric images and obtaining reliable velocity field from cross-correlation of these regions in multi-epoch observations.
    - Detection of structural information is performed using the segmented wavelet decomposition (SWD) method.

* [`GaussPy` - A Python tool for implementing Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition](https://github.com/gausspy/gausspy)
    - Based on the work of [Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2840)
* [`gausspyplus` - Fully automated Gaussian decomposition package for emission line spectra](https://github.com/mriener/gausspyplus)
    - `GaussPy+` is based on `GaussPy`: A python tool for implementing the Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition algorithm.

* [`Scintillometry` - A Package for Radio Baseband Data Reduction](https://github.com/mhvk/scintillometry)
    - `Scintillometry` is a package for reduction and analysis of radio baseband data, optimized for pulsar scintillometry science. [Online document is here](https://scintillometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
