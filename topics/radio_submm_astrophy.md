* [`wise` - Wavelet Image Segmentation and Evaluation tool](https://github.com/flomertens/wise)
    - `wise` is developed to address the issue of detecting significant features in radio interferometric images and obtaining reliable velocity field from cross-correlation of these regions in multi-epoch observations.
    - Detection of structural information is performed using the segmented wavelet decomposition (SWD) method.
