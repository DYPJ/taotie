## Transient Detection

- [exoplanet - Fast & scalable MCMC for all your exoplanet needs](https://github.com/dfm/exoplanet)
    * `exoplanet` is a toolkit for probabilistic modeling of transit and/or radial velocity observations of exoplanets and other astronomical time series using PyMC3.
    * By [Dan Foreman-Mackey](https://dfm.io/).

- [tls - An optimized transit-fitting algorithm to search for periodic transits of small planets](https://github.com/hippke/tls)
    * By Michael Hippke. Based on this [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...623A..39H/abstract)
    * TLS searches for transit-like features with stellar limb-darkening and including the effects of planetary ingress and egress

- [planetplanet - A general photodynamical code for exoplanet light curves](https://github.com/rodluger/planetplanet)
    * By [Rodrigo Luger](https://rodluger.github.io/). A general photodynamical code for modeling exoplanet transits, secondary eclipses, phase curves, and exomoons, as well as eclipsing binaries, circumbinary planets, and more

- [PyLDTk - Python Limb Darkening Toolkit](https://github.com/hpparvi/ldtk)
    * a Python toolkit for calculating stellar limb darkening profiles and model-specific coefficients for arbitrary passbands using the stellar spectrum model library by Husser et al (2013)

- [VESPA - Validation of Exoplanet Signals using a Probabilistic Algorithm](https://github.com/timothydmorton/VESPA)
    * By Timothy Morton. It calculats false positive probabilities for transit signals

## Radial Velocity

- [wobble - precise data-driven RV fitting, now with tellurics](https://github.com/megbedell/wobble)
    * By [Megan Bedell](https://bedell.space/) wobble is an open-source python package for analyzing time-series spectra. It was designed with stabilized extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) spectrographs in mind, but is highly flexible and extensible to a variety of applications.
