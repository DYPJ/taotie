# Transients and Other Time Series Science

* Focusing on the detection and analysis of any object that shows flux variation.
    - For example: variable stars, TDE, and eclipsing binaries.
    - **Exoplanet** and **supernova** are also trasients, but they have much broader impact therefore they have their own topics.

## Tools

- [lightkurve - A friendly package for Kepler & TESS time series analysis in Python](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve)
    * `Lightkurve` is a community-developed, open-source Python package which offers a beautiful and user-friendly way to analyze astronomical flux time series data, in particular the pixels and lightcurves obtained by NASA's Kepler and TESS exoplanet missions.

- [eleanor - light curves from TESS](https://github.com/afeinstein20/eleanor)
    * `eleanor` is a python package to extract target pixel files from TESS Full Frame Images and produce systematics-corrected light curves for any star observed by the TESS mission.

- [starry - Analytic occultation light curves for astronomy]()
    * By [Rodrigo Luger](https://rodluger.github.io/). Based on [a very nice paper](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/rodluger/starry/raw/master-pdf/tex/starry.pdf)

- [everest - EPIC Variability Extraction and Removal for Exoplanet Science Targets](https://github.com/rodluger/everest)
    * A pipeline for de-trending K2 light curves with pixel level decorrelation and Gaussian processes.]

- [wotan - Automagically remove trends from time-series data](https://github.com/hippke/wotan)
    * By [Michael Hippke](http://www.jaekle.info/). Offers free and open source algorithms to automagically remove trends from time-series data.
