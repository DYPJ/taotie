# Group or Cluster Detection Algorithms

* This topic has become more and more important for the study of galaxy-halo connection.

## Based on clustering of galaxie

- [sfof - Friends-of-Friends Galaxy Cluster Detection Algorithm](https://github.com/sfarrens/sfof)
    * By [Samuel Farrens](https://sfarrens.github.io/). SFoF is a friends-of-friends galaxy cluster detection algorithm that operates in either spectroscopic or photometric redshift space. The linking parameters, both transverse and along the line-of-sight, change as a function of redshift to account for selection effects.

## Based on red-sequence of the cluster members

- [redMaPPer - The Red-sequence Cluster Finder](https://github.com/erykoff/redmapper)
    * By [Eli Rykoff](https://github.com/erykoff). This is the open-source, python version of the red-sequence matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation (redMaPPer) cluster finder, originally described in Rykoff et al. (2014), with updates described in Rozo et al. (2015) and Rykoff et al. (2016).

## Test cluster finder in mock catalog

- [pycymatch](https://github.com/sfarrens/pycymatch)
    * `Pycymatch` is a cylindrical matching code for identifying matches between a catalogue of simulated dark matter haloes populated with galaxies and the results of a cluster detection algorithm run on said catalogue.
