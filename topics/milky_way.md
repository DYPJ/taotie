# Tools and Resources for Milky Way Related Research 

* Focusing on the dynamic and stellar population sides.

## Dynamics

* [gala - Galactic and gravitational dynamics in Python](https://github.com/adrn/gala)
    * Provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations, and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics.
    * Online [document is here](http://gala.adrian.pw/en/latest/)

* [thejoker - A custom Monte Carlo sampler for the (gravitational) two-body problem](https://github.com/adrn/thejoker)
    * The Joker [1] is a custom Monte Carlo sampler for the two-body problem and is therefore useful for constraining star-star or star-planet systems


## Stellar structures in the Milky Way

* [galstreams - Milky Way Streams Footprint Library and Toolkit for Python](https://github.com/cmateu/galstreams)
    * It includes a compilation of spatial information for known stellar streams and overdensities in the Milky Way (MW) and Python tools for visualizing them.

## `Gaia` related 

### Python tools:

* [pyia - A Python package for working with Gaia data](https://github.com/adrn/pyia)
